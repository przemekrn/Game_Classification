# Game_Classification

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project
This project is a **university assignment** for a course on artificial intelligence. The goal is to classify images of popular computer games into their respective categories using deep learning techniques. The project involves data preparation, model training, and evaluation, providing a hands-on experience in building and deploying a machine learning model.

## ðŸŒŸ DataSet
The dataset used in this project can be found here: [Dataset Link]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/your-dataset-link-here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uz5VjUQv4hz8txJU5p3qxe2-nWKUNxMb/)). It contains images of popular games such as Minecraft, Wiedzmin, Cyberpunk, and GTA, along with their corresponding labels.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
The project focuses on classifying game images into predefined categories. We use a combination of data preprocessing, deep learning, and visualization techniques to achieve this. Despite the challenges of working with image data and limited computational resources, the project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive coding and documentation.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and results.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For image processing tasks.
- **gdown**: For downloading the dataset from Google Drive.
